== Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will:

* Monitor enhanced Jenkins pipeline execution with integrated security
* Understand how security validation works within familiar Jenkins workflows  
* Experience GitOps-based deployment triggered from Jenkins
* Learn about monitoring and observability in enhanced Jenkins environments

== Understanding Enhanced Jenkins Pipeline Benefits

Your code commit has triggered a sophisticated Jenkins pipeline that demonstrates how RHADS enhances existing Jenkins investments:

=== Jenkins Enhancement Advantages

=== Familiar Jenkins Experience

* Standard Jenkins interface - No learning curve for existing teams
* Traditional pipeline patterns - Existing knowledge remains valuable
* Jenkins best practices - Enhanced with modern security capabilities
* Gradual adoption - Teams can enhance pipelines incrementally

=== Modern Security Integration

* Automated vulnerability scanning integrated into Jenkins stages
* Container image signing using familiar Jenkins pipeline syntax
* Policy enforcement without disrupting Jenkins workflows
* Compliance reporting generated automatically from Jenkins builds

== Activity 1: Monitoring Your Enhanced Jenkins Pipeline

=== Step 1: Access Jenkins Build Dashboard

. Navigate to your Jenkins instance (link from your component overview)
. Click on your triggered build number
. Review the pipeline execution with enhanced stages:
  * **Checkout** - Source code retrieval
  * **Build** - Application compilation
  * **Test** - Automated testing
  * **Security Scan** - Integrated vulnerability assessment
  * **Build Image** - Container image creation
  * **Sign Image** - Cryptographic signing
  * **Deploy to Stage** - GitOps-triggered deployment

=== Step 2: Examine Security Integration

. Click on the *Security Scan* stage in your Jenkins build
. Review the detailed vulnerability assessment report
. Notice how security scanning integrates seamlessly with Jenkins logging
. See how the pipeline automatically fails for critical vulnerabilities

TIP: The security scanning uses the same Jenkins pipeline syntax your team already knows - no new tools to learn.

=== Step 3: Verify Image Signing Process

. Click on the *Sign Image* stage
. See how your container image is cryptographically signed
. Review the signing artifacts and verification process
. Understand how this provides supply chain security within Jenkins

IMPORTANT: Image signing provides tamper-proof evidence integrated into your familiar Jenkins workflows.

=== Step 4: Monitor GitOps Integration

. Review the *Deploy to Stage* logs
. See how Jenkins triggers GitOps repository updates
. Notice how modern deployment patterns integrate with Jenkins CI
. Understand the bridge between Jenkins CI and GitOps CD

== Activity 2: Understanding Enhanced Jenkins Architecture

=== Step 1: Review Jenkins Pipeline Definition

. In your source code repository, open `Jenkinsfile`
. Review how security tools are integrated using familiar Jenkins syntax
. Notice how the pipeline maintains standard Jenkins patterns
. See how enhancements are additive, not disruptive

=== Step 2: Examine Security Tool Integration

. Review the Jenkins pipeline stages for security integration
. Notice how vulnerability scanning fits into standard Jenkins workflow
. See how container signing uses Jenkins credentials and secrets
. Understand how policy enforcement integrates with Jenkins approvals

=== Step 3: Understand GitOps Bridge

. Examine how Jenkins updates GitOps repositories
. See the GitLab repository changes triggered by your Jenkins build
. Review the staging deployment manifests
. Notice how Jenkins CI seamlessly triggers GitOps CD

TIP: This architecture preserves Jenkins value while adding modern GitOps capabilities.

== Activity 3: Validating Staging Deployment

=== Step 1: Access Staging Application

. In the OpenShift Console, navigate to *Topology*
. Switch to the staging namespace/project
. Find your application deployment
. Click on the route URL to access your running application

=== Step 2: Review Enhanced Monitoring

. Check the application health and status
. Review deployment logs showing the GitOps sync process
. Verify security policies are enforced in the staging environment
. See how Jenkins build artifacts flow through to deployment

=== Step 3: Test Application Functionality

. Access your Quarkus application endpoints
. Verify the application responds correctly with your changes
. Test functionality to ensure staging validation is successful
. Prepare for production promotion workflow

== Understanding Jenkins Investment Protection

=== What You Just Witnessed

== Troubleshooting Enhanced Jenkins Pipelines

=== Common Enhancement Issues

If your enhanced Jenkins pipeline fails:

. **Security scan failures**: Review vulnerability reports in Jenkins logs
. **Image signing issues**: Check Jenkins credentials and signing configuration
. **GitOps sync problems**: Verify repository permissions and webhook configuration
