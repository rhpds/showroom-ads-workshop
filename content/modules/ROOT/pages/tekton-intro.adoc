== Module Overview

Welcome to the OpenShift Pipelines development path! In this module, you'll experience how Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite enables modern, Kubernetes-native development workflows using OpenShift Pipelines.

== Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will:

* **Create secure applications** using self-service software templates
* **Develop in the cloud** using browser-based OpenShift Dev Spaces
* **Understand OpenShift Pipelines CI/CD** with Tekton workflows
* **Experience GitOps deployment** from development to production
* **See automated security** integrated throughout the development lifecycle

== Target Audience

This module serves development teams implementing cloud-native OpenShift Pipelines practices and platform engineers building modern DevOps workflows. Developers who want to experience modern, browser-based development environments will find the hands-on approach valuable. Organizations building applications on OpenShift will see how RHADS accelerates delivery while maintaining security and compliance. This path is particularly relevant for teams embracing Kubernetes-native architectures and cloud-native development patterns.

== Technology Stack

In this module, you'll work with:

**Development Environment:**

* Red Hat Developer Hub - Self-service portal
* OpenShift Dev Spaces - Browser-based IDE
* GitLab - Source code management

**CI/CD Platform:**

* OpenShift Pipelines - Kubernetes-native pipeline engine
* Red Hat Quay - Container image registry
* OpenShift GitOps (ArgoCD) - Automated deployment

**Security & Compliance:**

* Trusted Artifact Signer - Container image signing
* Advanced Cluster Security - Vulnerability scanning
* Enterprise Contract - Policy enforcement

== Business Context: ACME's OpenShift Pipelines Journey

ACME's development team is modernizing their architecture to compete in a fast-moving market. They need fast iteration cycles that enable rapid feature delivery and quick pivots based on customer feedback. Their development practices must scale as their team grows from dozens to hundreds of developers without creating bottlenecks. Security must be built-in from the start rather than bolted on later, protecting the business without slowing down development. Modern tooling becomes essential for attracting and retaining top developer talent in a competitive hiring market.

The challenge is clear: traditional development processes that worked at smaller scale now create unacceptable delays. Manual setup, custom configurations, and bolted-on security don't scale with modern Kubernetes architectures and distributed teams. The platform team becomes a bottleneck as they struggle to support growing demand with limited resources.

OpenShift Pipelines provides the solution through Kubernetes-native CI/CD that scales automatically with your workload. Pipelines integrate seamlessly with Kubernetes, eliminating the impedance mismatch between development and deployment. Self-service capabilities remove platform team bottlenecks, while built-in security ensures compliance without manual intervention.

== Module Structure

This module follows ACME's development workflow:

=== 1. Development - Building your application
* Access Red Hat Developer Hub
* Create a new Quarkus application using secure templates
* Set up your OpenShift Pipelines development environment
* Make your first code change and trigger a build

=== 2. Staging - Promoting to stage environment
* Understand the automated pipeline execution
* Review security scanning and validation results
* Promote your application to the staging environment
* Verify deployment using GitOps

=== 3. Production - Releasing to production
* Review staging validation and approvals
* Execute production deployment
* Monitor application health and security posture
* Understand the complete supply chain security

== Key Advantages of This Approach

The OpenShift Pipelines approach delivers advantages across developer experience, operations, and security.

Developer experience improves dramatically through modern, cloud-native tooling. Browser-based development eliminates local setup headaches, getting developers productive on day one. Environment provisioning happens instantly through self-service, removing the weeks of waiting that traditionally delay project starts. Live reload and rapid iteration enable tight feedback loops that accelerate learning and development. Integrated debugging and testing provide a complete development environment without manual tool installation and configuration.

Operational benefits stem from Kubernetes-native architecture that scales naturally. Scaling and resource management happen automatically through Kubernetes, eliminating manual capacity planning and intervention. GitOps automation ensures consistent deployments across all environments, reducing configuration drift and deployment failures. Built-in observability and monitoring provide visibility without additional tooling, while cloud portability works across any Kubernetes platform, avoiding vendor lock-in.

Security advantages come from security being built-in rather than bolted-on. Container-first security scanning catches vulnerabilities early in the development process. Immutable infrastructure patterns prevent configuration drift and unauthorized changes. Policy enforcement happens at the platform level, ensuring compliance without depending on developer discipline. Complete audit trails generate automatically for compliance, satisfying regulators without manual documentation.

IMPORTANT: This OpenShift Pipelines approach represents the future of enterprise development - you'll experience tomorrow's development practices today.

== Prerequisites

No prior experience with OpenShift Pipelines is required. This workshop assumes:

* Basic familiarity with containers and Kubernetes concepts
* Understanding of Git and basic development workflows
* Awareness of CI/CD pipeline concepts

TIP: Even if you're new to OpenShift Pipelines development, the workshop is designed to guide you through each step with clear explanations.
