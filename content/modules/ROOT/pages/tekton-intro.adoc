== Module Overview

Welcome to the OpenShift Pipelines development path! In this module, you'll experience how Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite enables modern, Kubernetes-native development workflows using OpenShift Pipelines.

== Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will:

* **Create secure applications** using self-service software templates
* **Develop in the cloud** using browser-based OpenShift Dev Spaces
* **Understand OpenShift Pipelines CI/CD** with Tekton workflows
* **Experience GitOps deployment** from development to production
* **See automated security** integrated throughout the development lifecycle

== Target Audience

This module is ideal for:

* **Development teams** implementing OpenShift Pipelines practices
* **Platform engineers** building modern DevOps workflows
* **Developers** wanting to experience modern development environments
* **Organizations** building applications on OpenShift

== Technology Stack

In this module, you'll work with:

**Development Environment:**

* Red Hat Developer Hub - Self-service portal
* OpenShift Dev Spaces - Browser-based IDE
* GitLab - Source code management

**CI/CD Platform:**

* OpenShift Pipelines - Kubernetes-native pipeline engine
* Red Hat Quay - Container image registry
* OpenShift GitOps (ArgoCD) - Automated deployment

**Security & Compliance:**

* Trusted Artifact Signer - Container image signing
* Advanced Cluster Security - Vulnerability scanning
* Enterprise Contract - Policy enforcement

== Business Context: ACME's OpenShift Pipelines Journey

ACME's development team is modernizing their architecture with OpenShift Pipelines. They need:

* **Fast iteration cycles** for competitive advantage
* **Scalable development practices** for their growing team
* **Built-in security** that doesn't slow down development
* **Modern tooling** that attracts top developer talent

**The Challenge:**

Traditional development processes take too long and don't scale with modern Kubernetes architectures.

**The Solution:**

OpenShift Pipelines provide CI/CD that scales automatically and integrates seamlessly with Kubernetes.

== Module Structure

This module follows ACME's development workflow:

=== 1. Development - Building your application

* Access Red Hat Developer Hub
* Create a new Quarkus application using secure templates
* Set up your OpenShift Pipelines development environment
* Make your first code change and trigger a build

=== 2. Staging - Promoting to stage environment

* Understand the automated pipeline execution
* Review security scanning and validation results
* Promote your application to the staging environment
* Verify deployment using GitOps

=== 3. Production - Releasing to production

* Review staging validation and approvals
* Execute production deployment
* Monitor application health and security posture
* Understand the complete supply chain security

== Why This Approach Works

=== For Development Teams

**Cloud-Native Development:**

* Browser-based development - no local setup required
* Instant environment provisioning
* Consistent development environments across all team members
* No "works on my machine" issues

**Modern Workflows:**

* GitOps-based deployment eliminates manual steps
* Automated security scanning integrated into development flow
* Self-service capabilities reduce dependency on platform teams
* Live reload and rapid iteration
* Focus on writing code, not managing infrastructure

=== For Platform Teams

**Operational Efficiency:**

* Dramatic reduction in manual setup requests
* Standardized templates ensure consistency
* Self-service capabilities scale team effectiveness
* Platform investment focuses on innovation

**Built-in Best Practices:**

* Kubernetes-native scaling and resource management
* Security scanning and policy enforcement automated
* GitOps ensures declarative, auditable deployments
* Complete observability and monitoring
* Cloud-portable across any Kubernetes platform

=== When This Approach Excels

**Ideal Use Cases:**

* New application development with modern architectures
* Microservices and container-first organizations
* Teams adopting Kubernetes and cloud-native practices
* Organizations prioritizing developer experience and velocity

**Organizational Readiness:**

* Commitment to Kubernetes as application platform
* Cultural alignment with DevOps and automation
* Teams comfortable with cloud-native concepts
* Desire for modern development tooling

IMPORTANT: This OpenShift Pipelines approach represents the future of enterprise development - you'll experience tomorrow's development practices today.

== Prerequisites

No prior experience with OpenShift Pipelines is required. This workshop assumes:

* Basic familiarity with containers and Kubernetes concepts
* Understanding of Git and basic development workflows
* Awareness of CI/CD pipeline concepts

TIP: Even if you're new to OpenShift Pipelines development, the workshop is designed to guide you through each step with clear explanations.
