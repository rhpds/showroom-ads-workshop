== Module Overview

Welcome to the cloud-native development path! In this module, you'll experience how Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite enables modern, Kubernetes-native development workflows using OpenShift Pipelines.

== Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will:

* **Create secure applications** using self-service software templates
* **Develop in the cloud** using browser-based OpenShift Dev Spaces
* **Understand cloud-native CI/CD** with cloud-native pipelines
* **Experience GitOps deployment** from development to production
* **See automated security** integrated throughout the development lifecycle

== Target Audience

This module is ideal for:

* **Development teams** implementing cloud-native practices
* **Platform engineers** building modern DevOps workflows
* **Developers** wanting to experience modern development environments
* **Organizations** building applications on OpenShift

== Technology Stack

In this module, you'll work with:

**Development Environment:**
* Red Hat Developer Hub - Self-service portal
* OpenShift Dev Spaces - Browser-based IDE
* GitLab - Source code management

**CI/CD Platform:**
* OpenShift Pipelines - Cloud-native pipeline engine
* Red Hat Quay - Container image registry
* OpenShift GitOps (ArgoCD) - Automated deployment

**Security & Compliance:**
* Trusted Artifact Signer - Container image signing
* Advanced Cluster Security - Vulnerability scanning
* Enterprise Contract - Policy enforcement

## Business Context: ACME's Cloud-Native Journey

ACME's development team is modernizing their architecture to be cloud-native. They need:

* **Fast iteration cycles** for competitive advantage
* **Scalable development practices** for their growing team
* **Built-in security** that doesn't slow down development
* **Modern tooling** that attracts top developer talent

**The Challenge:**
Traditional development processes take too long and don't scale with cloud-native architectures.

**The Solution:**
Cloud-native pipelines provide CI/CD that scales automatically and integrates seamlessly with Kubernetes.

== Module Structure

This module follows ACME's development workflow:

=== 1. Development - Building your application
* Access Red Hat Developer Hub
* Create a new Quarkus application using secure templates
* Set up your cloud-native development environment
* Make your first code change and trigger a build

=== 2. Staging - Promoting to stage environment  
* Understand the automated pipeline execution
* Review security scanning and validation results
* Promote your application to the staging environment
* Verify deployment using GitOps

=== 3. Production - Releasing to production
* Review staging validation and approvals
* Execute production deployment
* Monitor application health and security posture
* Understand the complete supply chain security

== Key Advantages of This Approach

**Developer Experience:**
* Browser-based development - no local setup required
* Instant environment provisioning
* Live reload and rapid iteration
* Integrated debugging and testing

**Operational Benefits:**
* Kubernetes-native scaling and resource management
* GitOps automation for consistent deployments
* Built-in observability and monitoring
* Cloud-portable across any Kubernetes platform

**Security Advantages:**
* Container-first security scanning
* Immutable infrastructure patterns  
* Policy enforcement at the platform level
* Complete audit trails for compliance

IMPORTANT: This cloud-native approach represents the future of enterprise development - you'll experience tomorrow's development practices today.

== Prerequisites

No prior experience with OpenShift Pipelines is required. This workshop assumes:

* Basic familiarity with containers and Kubernetes concepts
* Understanding of Git and basic development workflows
* Awareness of CI/CD pipeline concepts

TIP: Even if you're new to cloud-native development, the workshop is designed to guide you through each step with clear explanations.
