**What You've Accomplished:**
You've initiated an automated production pipeline that will perform enterprise security validation before allowing deployment to production.

== Activity 2: Understanding Pipeline Tasks

The production pipeline provides enterprise-grade security validation while eliminating manual bottlenecks. Let's examine each task in detail.

=== Task 1.1: extract-destination-image-tag

**Purpose:** Production image tag extraction from Git releases

This task extracts the Git tag from the GitLab Release and converts it to a production image tag, enabling:

* Production release coordination through GitLab Releases
* Complete audit trails for production deployments
* End-to-end traceability from release to production deployment

=== Task 1.2: gather-images-to-verify

**Purpose:** Production image selection and metadata generation

This task selects the production-ready image based on the Git tag and generates `images.json`, which:

* Ensures only production-validated images are considered for deployment
* Provides production deployment metadata for compliance
* Creates mapping between Git release and production container image

[NOTE]
====
This mapping between Git release and production image provides end-to-end traceability — we know exactly what release went into what production deployment.
====

**Sample `images.json` for production:**
[source,json,subs="attributes"]
----
{
  "components": [
    {
      "containerImage": "quay-{guid}/tssc/qrks-tkn-{user}:v1.0",
      "source": {
        "git": {
          "url": "{gitlab_url}/development/qrks-tkn-{user}",
          "revision": "v1.0"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
----

=== Task 2: verify-enterprise-contract

**Purpose:** Production security validation through Enterprise Contract

This step enforces production-grade security validations that protect your business and customers:

**Production Security Validations:**

* **Container image signature verification** using cryptographic signing
* **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) validation** for production supply chain security
* **CVE scanning** to prevent production vulnerabilities
* **Production policy compliance** ensuring enterprise security standards
* **Provenance attestation** to verify production build integrity

**Production Business Value:**

* Production security validation: 2-3 weeks → Minutes
* Production risk prevention before customer exposure
* Production audit readiness for compliance
* Automatic production CVE scanning and policy enforcement

**Production Enterprise Impact:**

* Production incident prevention: Issues caught before customer exposure
* Production audit confidence: Complete compliance evidence
* Production deployment velocity: Minutes instead of weeks
* Production risk elimination: 100% consistent security enforcement

[IMPORTANT]
====
If any production security check fails, the pipeline halts. Only fully validated images proceed to production deployment.
====

**Production Technical Implementation:**

The Enterprise Contract CLI performs production validation:

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
ec validate image \
  --image quay-{guid}/tssc/qrks-tkn-{user}:v1.0 \
  --policy production \
  --public-key k8s://openshift/trusted-keys \
  --output json
----

**Production validation output:**
[source,json]
----
{
  "successes": [
    "Production image is signed and verified with cosign",
    "Production SBOM (CycloneDX) is present",
    "Production provenance attestation matches source repo",
    "No production vulnerabilities found",
    "Production policy compliance verified"
  ],
  "failures": []
}
----

=== Task 3: copy-image

**Purpose:** Production image promotion with security designation

This task promotes the production-validated image with a production tag (e.g., `prod-v1.0`), ensuring:

* Only production-validated images receive production designation
* Production-grade security assurance
* No unauthorized images reach production deployment

**Production Technical Implementation:**

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
skopeo copy \
  docker://quay-{guid}/tssc/qrks-tkn-{user}:v1.0 \
  docker://quay-{guid}/tssc/qrks-tkn-{user}:prod-v1.0
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
This guarantees that only production-validated artifacts are promoted — no unauthorized images slip through to production.
====

=== Task 4: update-deployment

**Purpose:** Production GitOps deployment automation

This task ensures production-validated changes reach production automatically through GitOps, enabling:

* Production deployment immediately after validation completion
* Production configuration validation before customer exposure
* No manual production coordination needed
* Production success ensures customer satisfaction

[NOTE]
====
No manual production kubectl commands, no production YAML editing — the system automatically deploys to production based on Git. That's the production GitOps advantage.
====

**Production GitOps Implementation:**

The pipeline updates production deployment files automatically:

**Production `kustomization.yaml`:**
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
  - ../../base
patchesStrategicMerge:
  - deployment-patch.yaml
----

**Production `deployment-patch.yaml`:**
[source,yaml,subs="attributes"]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: qrks-tkn-{user}
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: qrks-tkn-{user}
          image: quay-{guid}/tssc/qrks-tkn-{user}:prod-v1.0
----

**Production Git diff showing automatic update:**
[source,diff,subs="attributes"]
----
-          image: quay-{guid}/tssc/qrks-tkn-{user}:v1.0
+          image: quay-{guid}/tssc/qrks-tkn-{user}:prod-v1.0
----

== Activity 3: Observing Production GitOps Deployment

Watch how ArgoCD automatically syncs your validated changes to the production environment.

ArgoCD (OpenShift GitOps) continuously monitors your GitOps repository and automatically applies any changes to your production environment. When the pipeline updates deployment manifests, ArgoCD detects these changes and deploys them without any manual intervention - ensuring your production environment always matches what's defined in Git.

**Step 1: Verify Production Deployment Updates**

* Access your GitOps repository at {gitlab_url}/development/qrks-tkn-{user}-gitops[qrks-tkn-{user}-gitops^]
* Check the updated deployment manifests in the `components/qrks-tkn-{user}/overlays/prod` directory
* In the `deployment-patch.yaml` file, notice how the image tag has been automatically updated to your release (e.g., `prod-v1.0`)
* Observe that this happens without any manual intervention

**Step 2: Monitor ArgoCD Production Synchronization**

* ArgoCD automatically detects the Git changes in your GitOps repository
* ArgoCD syncs these changes to the production environment
* The production deployment completes successfully without manual kubectl commands

**Step 3: Validate Production Environment**

* In the `Topology` tab in Developer Hub, locate the production application `qrks-tkn-{user}-prod` and click on the 'Open URL' icon (the arrow on the top right of your application) to open the route.
* Verify that your changes are live and functioning correctly in production
[NOTE]
====
It might take ArgoCD a few minutes to sync your changes.  Refresh your app browser window after a minute.
====
* Confirm that the production environment matches your expectations
