== Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will:

* Execute production deployment using enhanced Jenkins workflows
* Monitor production application health through Jenkins integration
* Understand the complete enhanced Jenkins supply chain security model
* Comprehend how RHADS preserves Jenkins investment while adding modern capabilities

== Understanding Enhanced Jenkins Production Deployment

Production deployments with enhanced Jenkins maintain familiar patterns while adding enterprise-grade security and automation:

=== Enhanced Jenkins Production Benefits

**Familiar Jenkins Workflows:**
* Production deployments use standard Jenkins pipeline patterns
* Existing Jenkins approval processes remain valid
* Traditional Jenkins role-based access control applies
* Jenkins build promotion workflows enhanced with security

**Modern Security Integration:**
* All production deployments include automated security validation
* Container images must pass signing verification
* Supply chain security enforced through Jenkins pipelines
* Compliance reporting generated from Jenkins build history

**Investment Protection:**
* Existing Jenkins infrastructure handles production workloads
* Jenkins expertise directly applicable to enhanced workflows
* Gradual enhancement possible for existing production pipelines
* No disruption to established operational procedures

== Activity 1: Production Release Preparation

=== Step 1: Validate Staging Success in Jenkins

. In your Jenkins dashboard, review the staging build results
. Verify all security scans passed successfully
. Check application health metrics from staging deployment
. Confirm image signing and verification completed successfully

=== Step 2: Review Enhanced Security Posture

. In Jenkins, navigate to the build artifacts section
. Review the security scan reports and vulnerability assessments
. Verify the container image signature validation status
. Check compliance policy adherence documented in Jenkins

TIP: All security validation is visible through familiar Jenkins interfaces - no additional tools required.

=== Step 3: Examine Enhanced Supply Chain Evidence

. Review the Jenkins build history showing complete audit trail
. See the cryptographic signatures and attestations
. Check the complete build provenance information
. Understand how Jenkins provides enterprise audit capabilities

IMPORTANT: Enhanced Jenkins provides complete supply chain security while maintaining familiar operational patterns.

== Activity 2: Production Deployment Execution

=== Step 1: Trigger Production Promotion

The production deployment demonstrates Jenkins-based approval workflows enhanced with modern security:

. In your Jenkins dashboard, locate the production promotion job
. Review the production deployment parameters and security validation
. Trigger the production deployment using familiar Jenkins interface
. Monitor the enhanced production pipeline execution

=== Step 2: Monitor Enhanced Production Pipeline

. Watch the Jenkins production pipeline execute
. See how security validation repeats for production deployment
. Monitor the GitOps repository updates triggered by Jenkins
. Verify the production deployment succeeds with enhanced security

=== Step 3: Verify Production Application

. Access your production application through the provided route
. Verify all functionality works as expected in production
. Check application health through OpenShift console
. Confirm production monitoring and alerting are active

== Activity 3: Production Monitoring with Enhanced Jenkins

=== Step 1: Application Health Monitoring

. Review production application metrics through Jenkins integration
. Check resource utilization and performance indicators
. Verify health checks are functioning correctly
. Monitor application logs for any issues or warnings

=== Step 2: Enhanced Security Monitoring

. Monitor security events through Jenkins dashboard integration
. Review container security policies enforcement status
. Check for any runtime security violations or alerts
. Validate network policies and security controls

=== Step 3: Compliance Reporting

. Generate compliance reports from Jenkins build history
. Review security scan results and remediation status
. Document container image signatures and verification
. Create audit trails showing deployment approvals and validation

TIP: Enhanced Jenkins provides automated compliance documentation while maintaining familiar reporting patterns.
