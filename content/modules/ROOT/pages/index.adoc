Welcome to the Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite (RHADS) Workshop! 

In this hands-on workshop, you'll experience how modern development teams can deliver secure applications at enterprise speed without compromising on security or developer productivity.

== What You'll Learn

Throughout this workshop, you will:

* Experience self-service application creation using Red Hat Developer Hub software templates
* Understand how security is automated throughout the development lifecycle
* See GitOps deployment in action from development to production
* Learn about trusted software supply chains and how they protect your organization

== The Challenge

Modern development teams face a common dilemma: they need to move fast to meet business demands, but they also need to ensure security and compliance. Traditional approaches create bottlenecks:

* Long setup times: 2-3 weeks to get a new project configured
* Manual security reviews: Delays and inconsistencies in security processes  
* Platform team overhead: Developers waiting for infrastructure and pipeline setup
* Configuration drift: Inconsistent setups across different projects

== The RHADS Solution

Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite transforms this challenge by making security and compliance *automatic* instead of manual gates:

* Self-service: Developers create projects in minutes, not weeks
* Built-in security: Every pipeline includes enterprise-grade security scanning and signing
* Standardized templates: Consistent, compliant configurations across all projects
* Zero platform overhead: Automated infrastructure and pipeline creation

IMPORTANT: This workshop uses a pre-configured lab environment with all the necessary components already installed and ready for you to use.

== Lab Environment

Your lab environment includes:

* Red Hat Developer Hub: Internal developer portal with self-service capabilities
* OpenShift Dev Spaces: Browser-based development environment  
* GitLab: Source code management and Git repositories
* Red Hat Quay: Container image registry
* OpenShift Pipelines: Tekton-based CI/CD automation
* Enterprise security tools: Automated scanning, signing, and compliance

TIP: All credentials and access information are provided in the "Lab Access Information" section. Keep this handy throughout the workshop.

== Workshop Structure

This workshop is organized into phases that build upon each other:

. Getting started with Red Hat Developer Hub and creating your first application
. Making code changes in a secure development environment  
. Understanding how the secure pipeline works
. Promoting your application to production

Each phase includes both learning objectives and hands-on activities to reinforce the concepts.
