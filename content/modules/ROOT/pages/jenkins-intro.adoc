== Module Overview

Welcome to the enterprise integration path! In this module, you'll experience how Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite enhances existing Jenkins investments, providing modern capabilities while preserving valuable infrastructure and expertise.

== Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will:

* **Modernize Jenkins workflows** using self-service software templates
* **Integrate enterprise security** into existing Jenkins pipelines
* **Experience enhanced Jenkins** with automatic security scanning and signing
* **Understand GitOps deployment** from Jenkins-based CI/CD
* **See investment preservation** while gaining modern capabilities

== Target Audience

This module is ideal for:

* **Organizations with Jenkins investments** wanting to modernize without replacement
* **Enterprise teams** with established Jenkins expertise and infrastructure
* **Platform engineers** enhancing existing CI/CD capabilities
* **Organizations** balancing innovation with investment protection

== Technology Stack

In this module, you'll work with:

**Development Environment:**
* Red Hat Developer Hub - Self-service portal
* OpenShift Dev Spaces - Browser-based IDE
* GitLab - Source code management

**CI/CD Platform:**
* Jenkins - Enhanced with modern security integration
* Red Hat Quay - Container image registry
* OpenShift GitOps (ArgoCD) - Automated deployment

**Security & Compliance:**
* Trusted Artifact Signer - Container image signing
* Advanced Cluster Security - Vulnerability scanning
* Enterprise Contract - Policy enforcement

== Business Context: ACME's Jenkins Modernization

ACME has significant Jenkins investments powering critical applications. They need to:

* **Preserve Jenkins infrastructure** representing millions in investment
* **Enhance security capabilities** without disrupting existing workflows
* **Provide self-service options** to reduce platform team overhead
* **Modernize gradually** while maintaining operational stability

**The Challenge:**
Traditional Jenkins setups require extensive manual configuration and lack modern security integration.

**The Solution:**
RHADS transforms Jenkins into a modern, secure, self-service platform while preserving existing investments and expertise.

== Module Structure

This module follows ACME's Jenkins enhancement workflow:

=== 1. Development - Building your application
* Access Red Hat Developer Hub
* Create a new Quarkus application using Jenkins-enhanced templates
* Set up your modern development environment
* Make your first code change and trigger an enhanced Jenkins build

=== 2. Staging - Promoting to stage environment
* Understand the enhanced Jenkins pipeline execution
* Review integrated security scanning and validation
* Promote your application to the staging environment
* Verify deployment using GitOps automation

=== 3. Production - Releasing to production
* Review staging validation and enhanced approvals
* Execute production deployment with Jenkins
* Monitor application health and security posture
* Understand the modernized Jenkins supply chain

== Key Advantages of This Approach

**Investment Preservation:**
* Leverage existing Jenkins infrastructure and knowledge
* Maintain familiar workflows and processes
* Preserve team expertise and operational procedures
* Protect substantial technology investments

**Enhanced Capabilities:**
* Add modern security scanning without pipeline disruption
* Integrate container image signing and verification
* Provide self-service capabilities for developers
* Enable GitOps deployment patterns

**Gradual Modernization:**
* Enhance existing pipelines incrementally
* Introduce new capabilities without breaking changes
* Allow teams to adapt at their own pace
* Minimize disruption to production workloads

IMPORTANT: This approach demonstrates how RHADS enhances rather than replaces existing Jenkins investments, providing a practical modernization path.

* Network configurations and security boundaries maintained
* Operational procedures and runbooks remain valid

**Knowledge Preservation:**
* Jenkins expertise continues to be valuable and relevant
* Existing pipeline patterns can be enhanced incrementally
* Team training investments are protected
* Institutional knowledge remains applicable

**Gradual Enhancement:**
* New projects can adopt enhanced templates immediately
* Existing projects can be migrated at appropriate times
* Risk is minimized through incremental adoption
* Teams can learn new capabilities progressively

=== Modernization Benefits

**Immediate Value:**
* Self-service capabilities reduce platform team load
* Integrated security scanning improves security posture
* Standardized templates reduce configuration errors
* GitOps deployment automation improves reliability

**Long-term Strategic Value:**
* Foundation for eventual OpenShift Pipelines migration if desired
* Enhanced security and compliance capabilities
* Improved developer productivity and satisfaction
* Reduced operational overhead and maintenance burden

== Prerequisites

This workshop assumes:

* Basic familiarity with Jenkins concepts and pipelines
* Understanding of Git and development workflows
* Awareness of container and CI/CD pipeline concepts
* Some experience with OpenShift or Kubernetes (helpful but not required)

TIP: Even if you're new to Red Hat Developer Hub or GitOps, the workshop guides you through each step with clear explanations focused on enhancing your Jenkins experience.

== Implementation Approach

=== When This Approach Excels

**Enterprise Enhancement Benefits:**
