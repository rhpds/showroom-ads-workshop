== Module Overview

Welcome to the enterprise integration path! In this module, you'll experience how Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite enhances existing Jenkins investments, providing modern capabilities while preserving valuable infrastructure and expertise.

== Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will:

* **Modernize Jenkins workflows** using self-service software templates
* **Integrate enterprise security** into existing Jenkins pipelines
* **Experience enhanced Jenkins** with automatic security scanning and signing
* **Understand GitOps deployment** from Jenkins-based CI/CD
* **See investment preservation** while gaining modern capabilities

== Target Audience

**You should follow this path if:**
- You have Jenkins controllers and agents already running
- Your team knows Jenkins (Groovy pipelines, Blue Ocean, troubleshooting)
- You want modern security (image signing, SBOM, policy enforcement) without migrating off Jenkins
- You need to show ROI on existing Jenkins investment while adding new capabilities

**You'll learn:** How to layer RHADS security and self-service on top of Jenkins infrastructure you already own.

== Technology Stack

In this module, you'll work with:

**Development Environment:**

* Red Hat Developer Hub - Self-service portal
* OpenShift Dev Spaces - Browser-based IDE
* GitLab - Source code management

**CI/CD Platform:**

* Jenkins - Enhanced with modern security integration
* Red Hat Quay - Container image registry
* OpenShift GitOps (ArgoCD) - Automated deployment

**Security & Compliance:**

* Trusted Artifact Signer - Container image signing
* Advanced Cluster Security - Vulnerability scanning
* Enterprise Contract - Policy enforcement

== Business Context: ACME's Jenkins Modernization

**ACME's situation:**
- 50+ Jenkins pipelines in production
- Jenkins admins with 5+ years experience
- $2M invested in Jenkins controllers, agents, plugins
- Security team wants: image signing, SBOM, CVE scanning before production
- Developers want: faster project setup, fewer tickets to platform team

**Current problems:**
- Each new project = 40 hours platform team work (custom Jenkinsfile, plugin config, GitLab integration)
- Security tools bolted on inconsistently (some projects scan, some don't)
- No standardized way to promote dev → stage → prod

**RHADS solution:**
- Platform team creates one Jenkins template in Developer Hub
- Template includes: Jenkinsfile with `rhtap` library (handles scanning/signing), GitLab repo setup, GitOps repo creation
- Developers self-serve: fill form, get working Jenkins pipeline in 5 minutes
- Security automatic: `rhtap` library functions run ACS scan, Cosign signing, Enterprise Contract validation
- Jenkins stays: same controllers, agents, Blue Ocean interface your team knows

== Module Structure

This module follows ACME's Jenkins enhancement workflow:

=== 1. Development - Building your application
* Access Red Hat Developer Hub
* Create a new Quarkus application using Jenkins-enhanced templates
* Set up your modern development environment
* Make your first code change and trigger an enhanced Jenkins build

=== 2. Staging - Promoting to stage environment
* Understand the enhanced Jenkins pipeline execution
* Review integrated security scanning and validation
* Promote your application to the staging environment
* Verify deployment using GitOps automation

=== 3. Production - Releasing to production
* Review staging validation and enhanced approvals
* Execute production deployment with Jenkins
* Monitor application health and security posture
* Understand the modernized Jenkins supply chain

== Key Advantages of This Approach

**Investment preservation:**
- Keep Jenkins controllers, agents (no new infrastructure costs)
- Reuse team's Jenkins knowledge (no retraining on Tekton/other tools)
- Existing Jenkinsfiles still work (migration optional, not required)

**Enhanced capabilities without disruption:**
- Add security scanning: call `acs_image_scan()` from `rhtap` library in your Jenkinsfile
- Add image signing: call `cosign_sign_attest()`
- Add GitOps: call `update_deployment()` to update manifests, ArgoCD syncs automatically
- No plugin sprawl: security tools accessed via library functions, not individual Jenkins plugins

**Gradual adoption:**
- New projects: use enhanced template immediately
- Existing projects: migrate when convenient (or never—both models coexist)
- Brownfield-friendly: RHADS doesn't force "all or nothing" migration

**Example transition:**
```
Traditional Jenkins → RHADS-enhanced Jenkins
├── Manually configure each pipeline → Generate from template
├── Custom security scripts per project → Shared rhtap library functions
├── Manual kubectl apply → GitOps (update repo, ArgoCD deploys)
└── Artisanal each time → Standardized, repeatable
```

IMPORTANT: This approach enhances Jenkins, doesn't replace it. Your Jenkins expertise becomes more valuable, not obsolete.

== Understanding Jenkins Enhancement Benefits

=== For Jenkins Administrators

**Before RHADS:**
- 40 hours setting up each new Jenkins pipeline
- "Can you add security scanning to my pipeline?" tickets pile up
- Each project's Jenkinsfile slightly different (maintenance nightmare)
- Debugging: "Which version of the security plugin do they have?"

**After RHADS:**
- Maintain one template, developers self-serve (10 new projects = 2 hours to review template updates)
- Security scanning in `rhtap` library, called by all pipelines (one version, centrally updated)
- Template changes propagate: update library function → all pipelines using it benefit
- Debugging: "Check the `rhtap` library version" (consistent across projects)

**What you maintain:**
- Jenkins infrastructure (controllers, agents—unchanged)
- `rhtap` shared library (security functions)
- Developer Hub templates (project scaffolding)
- Enterprise Contract policies (what's allowed in production)

**What you don't maintain anymore:**
- Individual Jenkinsfiles for every project
- Custom security scripts per team
- Manual GitLab webhook configuration
- Deployment credentials per project (GitOps handles it)

=== For Development Teams

**Developer experience:**

**Creating a new project (before):**
1. Submit ticket: "Need Jenkins pipeline for new microservice"
2. Wait 1-2 weeks for platform team
3. Attend 3 meetings explaining requirements
4. Debug webhook configuration with GitLab admin
5. Manually add scanning after security team review

**Creating a new project (after):**
1. Go to Developer Hub, click "Create"
2. Choose "Quarkus with Jenkins" template
3. Fill form: app name, GitLab group
4. Click "Create"
5. Get: GitLab repo, Jenkinsfile with security, GitOps repo, Dev Spaces workspace

**What's in the generated Jenkinsfile:**
```groovy
// Automatically generated, includes:
- Maven build
- Buildah container build
- cosign_sign_attest() // Image signing
- acs_image_scan() // CVE scanning
- update_deployment() // GitOps update
- Enterprise Contract validation
```

**Key point:** You didn't write any of that security code. Template included it. You just customize your app code.

== Investment Protection Strategy

=== Preserving Jenkins Value

**Infrastructure reuse:**
- Jenkins controllers, agents run unchanged
- Same network, firewall rules, service accounts
- Existing compute/storage allocation stays
- No rip-and-replace migration downtime

**Knowledge reuse:**
- Groovy pipeline syntax still works
- Blue Ocean interface unchanged
- Troubleshooting skills (logs, replay, etc.) still apply
- Jenkins training/certifications still valuable

**Coexistence model:**
```
Your Jenkins environment
├── Legacy projects (unchanged)
│   └── Custom Jenkinsfiles, works as-is
├── RHADS-enhanced projects
│   └── Generated Jenkinsfiles + rhtap library
└── Hybrid projects
    └── Gradually migrating, both patterns work
```

**Migration path (when you're ready):**
1. Platform team creates template with rhtap library
2. New projects use template (instant modern security)
3. Existing projects migrate when business value justifies effort
4. No forced timeline—both approaches coexist indefinitely

**Risk mitigation:** Pilot with 1-2 projects before org-wide rollout. Learn, adjust template, then scale.

=== Modernization Benefits

**Immediate (week 1):**
- Developers create projects without tickets → platform team time freed
- Every build scans for CVEs → security posture improves
- Policies enforced automatically → no "oops, forgot to scan" incidents

**Short-term (month 1-3):**
- Fewer production security incidents (CVEs caught in dev/staging)
- Faster onboarding (new developers get working pipeline, not "read these 10 wiki pages")
- Audit prep easier (export logs showing every build passed policy checks)

**Long-term (year 1+):**
- Option to migrate to Tekton if needed (but no pressure—Jenkins works fine)
- Security capabilities improve as `rhtap` library updated (your pipelines benefit automatically)
- Recruitment easier ("We do modern DevSecOps" vs. "We have Jenkins from 2015")

== Prerequisites

This workshop assumes:

* Basic familiarity with Jenkins concepts and pipelines
* Understanding of Git and development workflows
* Awareness of container and CI/CD pipeline concepts
* Some experience with OpenShift or Kubernetes (helpful but not required)

TIP: Even if you're new to Red Hat Developer Hub or GitOps, the workshop guides you through each step with clear explanations focused on enhancing your Jenkins experience.

== Implementation Approach

=== When This Approach Excels

This Jenkins enhancement approach excels in specific enterprise contexts. Organizations with significant existing Jenkins infrastructure and expertise preserve those investments while gaining modern capabilities. Large portfolios of existing pipelines can be enhanced incrementally rather than requiring simultaneous migration. Teams that prefer familiar tooling and workflows maintain their Jenkins competency while expanding their capabilities. A gradual modernization approach reduces the risk and disruption inherent in big-bang replacements. Investment protection takes priority over pursuing the latest technology trends.

The approach delivers key capabilities that bridge traditional and modern practices. Self-service developer portal capabilities reduce platform team bottlenecks while maintaining governance. Integrated security scanning and compliance checking happen automatically within familiar Jenkins workflows. GitOps deployment automation provides declarative releases without abandoning Jenkins for CI. Complete supply chain security activates through pipeline enhancements rather than separate tooling. Platform team overhead decreases as standardization and automation replace custom configurations and manual processes.
