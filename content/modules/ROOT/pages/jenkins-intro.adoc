== Module Overview

Welcome to the enterprise integration path! In this module, you'll experience how Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite enhances existing Jenkins investments, providing modern capabilities while preserving valuable infrastructure and expertise.

== Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will:

* **Modernize Jenkins workflows** using self-service software templates
* **Integrate enterprise security** into existing Jenkins pipelines
* **Experience enhanced Jenkins** with automatic security scanning and signing
* **Understand GitOps deployment** from Jenkins-based CI/CD
* **See investment preservation** while gaining modern capabilities

== Target Audience

This module is ideal for:

* **Organizations with Jenkins investments** wanting to modernize without replacement
* **Enterprise teams** with established Jenkins expertise and infrastructure
* **Platform engineers** enhancing existing CI/CD capabilities
* **Organizations** balancing innovation with investment protection

== Technology Stack

In this module, you'll work with:

**Development Environment:**

* Red Hat Developer Hub - Self-service portal
* OpenShift Dev Spaces - Browser-based IDE
* GitLab - Source code management

**CI/CD Platform:**

* Jenkins - Enhanced with modern security integration
* Red Hat Quay - Container image registry
* OpenShift GitOps (ArgoCD) - Automated deployment

**Security & Compliance:**

* Trusted Artifact Signer - Container image signing
* Advanced Cluster Security - Vulnerability scanning
* Enterprise Contract - Policy enforcement

== Business Context: ACME's Jenkins Modernization

ACME has significant Jenkins investments powering critical applications. They need to:

* **Preserve Jenkins infrastructure** representing millions in investment
* **Enhance security capabilities** without disrupting existing workflows
* **Provide self-service options** to reduce platform team overhead
* **Modernize gradually** while maintaining operational stability

**The Challenge:**

Traditional Jenkins setups require extensive manual configuration and lack modern security integration.

**The Solution:**

RHADS transforms Jenkins into a modern, secure, self-service platform while preserving existing investments and expertise.

== Module Structure

This module follows ACME's Jenkins enhancement workflow:

=== 1. Development - Building your application

* Access Red Hat Developer Hub
* Create a new Quarkus application using Jenkins-enhanced templates
* Set up your modern development environment
* Make your first code change and trigger an enhanced Jenkins build

=== 2. Staging - Promoting to stage environment

* Understand the enhanced Jenkins pipeline execution
* Review integrated security scanning and validation
* Promote your application to the staging environment
* Verify deployment using GitOps automation

=== 3. Production - Releasing to production

* Review staging validation and enhanced approvals
* Execute production deployment with Jenkins
* Monitor application health and security posture
* Understand the modernized Jenkins supply chain

== Why This Approach Works

=== For Jenkins Administrators

**Investment Preservation:**

* Leverage existing Jenkins infrastructure representing millions in investment
* Preserve team expertise and operational procedures built over years
* Maintain familiar Jenkins workflows and processes that teams trust
* Protect substantial technology investments while gaining modern capabilities

**Reduced Configuration Overhead:**

* Self-service templates eliminate repetitive pipeline setup
* Standardized security integration across all projects
* Automated best practices enforcement
* Reduced maintenance burden for custom configurations

**Enhanced Security Integration:**

* Modern vulnerability scanning integrated seamlessly into Jenkins workflows
* Container image signing and verification without pipeline disruption
* Policy enforcement that works with existing Jenkins patterns
* Compliance reporting and audit trail generation automatically

=== For Development Teams

**Familiar Workflows with Modern Capabilities:**

* Jenkins pipelines work exactly as expected - no retraining needed
* Existing Jenkins knowledge remains valuable and becomes more powerful
* Gradual introduction of new capabilities at team's own pace
* No disruption to established practices or productivity

**Enhanced Developer Experience:**

* Self-service application creation in minutes instead of weeks
* Pre-configured Jenkins pipelines with enterprise security built-in
* Automatic repository and infrastructure setup
* Modern development environment access with GitOps automation
* Complete supply chain security without becoming security experts

**Faster Project Setup:**

* Immediate productivity without waiting for platform teams
* Standardized templates ensure consistency across projects
* Integrated development environments ready to use
* Automatic GitOps deployment configuration

=== When This Approach Excels

**Ideal Use Cases:**

* Significant existing Jenkins infrastructure and expertise to preserve
* Large number of production pipelines requiring continuity
* Organizational preference for gradual, low-risk modernization
* Team expertise and operational procedures that add value
* Investment protection as primary concern

**Organizational Readiness:**

* Teams with established Jenkins expertise wanting to enhance capabilities
* Organizations committed to protecting technology investments
* Cultural alignment with gradual transformation over disruptive replacement
* Desire for modern security without abandoning proven tools

**Core RHADS Benefits Delivered:**

* Self-service developer portal capabilities through Red Hat Developer Hub
* Integrated security scanning and compliance validation
* GitOps deployment automation and audit trail generation
* Complete supply chain security with cryptographic verification
* Dramatic reduction in platform team overhead

== Prerequisites

This workshop assumes:

* Basic familiarity with Jenkins concepts and pipelines
* Understanding of Git and development workflows
* Awareness of container and CI/CD pipeline concepts
* Some experience with OpenShift or Kubernetes (helpful but not required)

TIP: Even if you're new to Red Hat Developer Hub or GitOps, the workshop guides you through each step with clear explanations focused on enhancing your Jenkins experience.
