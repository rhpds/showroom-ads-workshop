= Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite Workshop

This workshop provides hands-on experience with Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite (RHADS), focusing on modern software delivery practices that accelerate secure application development and deployment.

== Workshop Overview

**Target Audience:** Developers and DevOps professionals looking to experience modern secure software delivery

**Learning Style:** Personal narrative journey where learners become the protagonist solving real business challenges

**Business Context:** You're a new developer at ACME Retail facing a Black Friday deadline crisis - learn how RHADS transforms traditional 10-week delivery cycles into 4-week successes

**Key Technologies:** Red Hat Developer Hub, OpenShift Pipelines (Tekton), Jenkins, GitLab, Quay, Advanced Cluster Security, Trusted Artifact Signer

== Workshop Features

. **Dual Learning Paths**: Choose between cloud-native (Tekton) or enterprise (Jenkins) implementation approaches
. **Personal Narrative Style**: Based on the successful storytelling approach from showroom-lb1696-jenkins-rhtap
. **Hands-on Activities**: Real development experience with modern security-integrated workflows
. **Progressive Learning**: From setup through production deployment with built-in security
. **Self-Service Focus**: Experience how RHADS eliminates traditional platform team bottlenecks

== Getting Started

=== Using Containers (Recommended)

In order to test and develop on your local machine, you can use a specially built container with Podman or Docker as follows.

. Create a git repo from this template
.. Suggested naming: `showroom_<lab-name>`
. Clone your new repo and `cd` into it
. When you make changes to the content, all you need is to kill the container and run it again.
+
[source,sh]
----
podman run --rm --name antora -v $PWD:/antora -p 8080:8080 -i -t ghcr.io/juliaaano/antora-viewer
----

For SELinux environments, `:z` may need to be appended to the volume mount:

----
podman run --rm --name antora -v $PWD:/antora:z -p 8080:8080 -i -t ghcr.io/juliaaano/antora-viewer
----

Live-reload is not supported.

=== Using Local Files (Less Recommended)

. Create a git repo from this template
. Clone the repo and `cd` into it
. Run ./utilities/lab-serve
. Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser
. Run ./utilities/lab-build to build your html

To rebuild your html, run `./utilities/lab-build`.

== Workshop Learning Paths

The workshop offers two distinct paths that demonstrate different approaches to implementing RHADS:

=== ðŸš€ Cloud-Native Pipeline Path (Tekton)
**Perfect for teams embracing modern cloud-native development practices**

* **tekton-intro.adoc** - Introduction to cloud-native development challenges
* **tekton-dev.adoc** - Development phase with self-service app creation 
* **tekton-stage.adoc** - Staging environment promotion and testing
* **tekton-prod.adoc** - Production deployment with GitOps
* **tekton-finish.adoc** - Summary and next steps

=== ðŸ”§ Enterprise Pipeline Path (Jenkins)  
**Ideal for organizations with existing enterprise tooling investments**

* **jenkins-intro.adoc** - Introduction to enterprise development enhancement
* **jenkins-dev.adoc** - Development phase with enhanced Jenkins integration
* **jenkins-stage.adoc** - Staging environment with enterprise workflows
* **jenkins-prod.adoc** - Production deployment maintaining enterprise patterns
* **jenkins-finish.adoc** - Summary and enterprise transformation insights

== Personal Narrative Approach

This workshop follows the engaging storytelling style pioneered in `showroom-lb1696-jenkins-rhtap`:

**You as the Protagonist:** Learners become a new developer at ACME Retail facing real business challenges

**Emotional Investment:** Personal stakes in solving the Black Friday deadline crisis

**Progressive Empowerment:** Journey from frustration with traditional processes to confidence with RHADS

**Hands-on Discovery:** Learning through doing rather than just reading about concepts

=== Narrative Elements

* **Personal challenges:** "You've been dealing with 1-2 weeks of Jenkins setup tickets..."
* **Emotional reactions:** "Finally!" you think, "A template that includes security built-in"  
* **Internal thoughts:** "This is going to change everything," you think to yourself
* **Achievement moments:** "You feel a sense of accomplishment" with successful signed commits
* **Progressive discovery:** From "Your Current Reality" to "Your New Reality with RHADS"

== Workshop Flow

. **Introduction** - Meet your new role at ACME and the Black Friday challenge
. **Path Selection** - Choose between cloud-native (Tekton) or enterprise (Jenkins) approach
. **Development Phase** - Create your first secure application with self-service templates
. **Staging Phase** - Experience automated promotion and testing workflows  
. **Production Phase** - Deploy with confidence using GitOps and integrated security
. **Reflection** - Understand the transformation you've experienced

== Technical Implementation

The workshop demonstrates key RHADS capabilities:

* **Self-Service Development** - Red Hat Developer Hub templates eliminate platform team bottlenecks
* **Integrated Security** - Automatic vulnerability scanning, image signing, and policy enforcement
* **GitOps Deployment** - Automated, auditable deployments across environments
* **Developer Experience** - Browser-based development with OpenShift Dev Spaces
* **Pipeline Automation** - Both Tekton (cloud-native) and Jenkins (enterprise) implementations
* **Compliance** - Built-in audit trails and governance without developer friction

== Contributing

When editing workshop content:

. Use the personal narrative voice ("You" rather than "The user")
. Include emotional context and reactions
. Focus on the learner's journey and transformation
. Maintain technical accuracy while emphasizing the human experience
. Use screenshots and images to support the narrative flow
