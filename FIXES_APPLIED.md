## Date: 2025-10-22

All fixes from the senior editorial review have been systematically applied across the workshop content.

---

## CRITICAL FIXES (✅ COMPLETED)

### 1. ✅ Removed Internal Monologue Quotes

**Files:** tekton-dev.adoc, jenkins-dev.adoc

**Changes:**
- Removed: `"This is going to change everything," you think to yourself`
- Removed: `"Perfect!" you think, "This is exactly what I need..."`
- Removed: `"you wonder"` phrases
- Removed: `"excited to see what happens next"`

**Result:** Professional, direct tone throughout

### 2. ✅ Standardized Learning Objectives Format

**Files:** tekton-dev.adoc

**Changes:**
- Added **bolded verbs** to match jenkins-dev.adoc format:
  - `* **Access** Red Hat Developer Hub...`
  - `* **Create** a new secure Quarkus application...`
  - `* **Experience** self-service development...`
  - `* **Understand** how security is built...`

**Result:** Consistent format across both paths

### 3. ✅ Fixed POV Consistency

**Files:** tekton-dev.adoc

**Changes:**
- Changed: `As ACME's newest developer, you're facing...`
- To: `As a developer working with modern Kubernetes-native applications, you're facing...`

**Result:** Direct 2nd person, no character framing

### 4. ✅ Standardized Admonition Formatting

**Files:** jenkins-dev.adoc, tekton-dev.adoc

**Changes:**
- Converted all inline admonitions (e.g., `TIP: Text here`) to block format:
```
[TIP]
====
Text here
====
```

**Fixed instances:**
- jenkins-dev.adoc: 3 admonitions (lines 54, 66, 120, 187)
- tekton-dev.adoc: 1 admonition (line 346)

**Result:** Consistent block format throughout

---

## HIGH PRIORITY FIXES (✅ COMPLETED)

### 5. ✅ Removed Marketing Language

**Files:** tekton-dev.adoc, jenkins-dev.adoc

**Changes:**
- Removed: `the magic of self-service`
- Removed: `something revolutionary`
- Removed: `You'll be amazed at how empowering this feels!`
- Removed: `embark on your journey`
- Removed: `exciting part`
- Removed: `You're about to witness something powerful/amazing`

**Replaced with factual language:**
- `Now you'll create a new application using self-service templates...`
- `Let's begin by logging into your development environment...`
- `This single template will automatically create...` (no hyperbole)

**Result:** Professional, factual tone without marketing hype

### 6. ✅ Removed Informal Scare Quotes

**Files:** tekton-dev.adoc, jenkins-dev.adoc

**Changes:**
- Changed: `resources that "just work"`
- To: `resources that work seamlessly`

**Result:** Professional language without informal quotation marks

### 7. ✅ Simplified "Zero X:" Lists

**Files:** tekton-dev.adoc, jenkins-dev.adoc

**Before:**
```
* Zero waiting time: You'll create GitLab repos...
* Zero configuration complexity: Kubernetes resources...
* Zero security gaps: Container scanning...
* Zero platform team dependency: You become...
```

**After:**
```
With RHADS, you can work differently:

* Create GitLab repos and OpenShift Pipelines instantly - no tickets, no waiting
* Kubernetes resources get generated automatically - you focus on your application code
* Container scanning and signing happen automatically - security is integrated seamlessly
* Become self-sufficient and productive immediately without platform team dependency
```

**Result:** More natural, less repetitive format

### 8. ✅ Fixed Terminology Consistency

**Files:** tekton-dev.adoc

**Changes:**
- Removed casual language:
  - Changed: `Eager to get started on your Black Friday project you spot`
  - To: `Click the **+** button (Self-service) in the top-right corner`

  - Changed: `you click **+** and are amazed to see a catalog`
  - To: `Browse the catalog of ready-to-use templates`

  - Changed: `click it curiously`
  - To: `click the link for *OpenShift Dev Spaces*`

**Result:** Consistent professional terminology

## REMAINING RECOMMENDATIONS

### Medium Priority (Not Yet Addressed):
1. **Sentence length** - Some sentences still exceed 25-30 words
2. **Heading capitalization** - Consider sentence case throughout
3. **Activity naming** - Could further standardize naming convention
4. **"What You Just..." sections** - Placement could be more consistent

### Future Improvements:
1. Create formal style guide based on these changes
2. Review stage/prod files with same standards
3. Review finish/intro files for similar issues
4. Verify all technical accuracy

## QUALITY ASSURANCE

All changes have been:
- ✅ Applied systematically
- ✅ Verified for correct AsciiDoc syntax
- ✅ Tested for consistency across both paths
- ✅ Reviewed for tone and professionalism

## NEXT STEPS

1. Review applied changes
2. Test rendering of all admonition blocks
3. Verify image links still work
4. Check TOC rendering with new headings
5. Consider applying similar fixes to stage/prod/finish files
